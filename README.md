RSA Encryption/Decryption Program

Instructions:

  Create encryption & decryption keys:
    1. Enter two distinctive (greater than 10) primes p and q
    2. Enter an integer e so that gcd(e,phi(n)) = 1
    3. Use the Public encryption key to encrypt messages.
    4. Use the Private decryption key to decrypt messages.

  RSA Encryption:
    1. Enter e and n values in the Public encryption key
    2. Enter message to be encrypted (< 100000 chars)
    3. Record the ciphered text info
    4. Record the number of characters in the text
  
  RSA Decryption:\n");
    1. Enter d and n values in the Private decryption key
    2. Enter the number of chars in the encrypted text
    3. Enter the each chars in the encrypted text
